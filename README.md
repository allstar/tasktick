# TaskTick

An example Task Manager project that has been created using Lagom.  
It is fantastic ;)


## Overview
This project goes with my blog post and serves to demo how fast and easy it is to produce a modern progressive web application with Lagom.

Some of the features include:

* React FrontEnd (PWA) that connects to the Lagom backend using a WebSocket connection.
* JWT authentication and Auth management:
    * This includes login and registration
    * Restricting access to routes based on the jwt auth token.
* Publish Events to kafka stream (for a future Notification or other services) 
* Handle OAuth flow to allow for users to connect their github accounts.
* Event Sourced Project and User Entities
